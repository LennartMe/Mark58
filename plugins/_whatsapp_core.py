"""
Shared WhatsApp access layer for the JARVIS WhatsApp plugins.

NOT A PLUGIN. The leading underscore keeps the loader from treating it as one
(core/plugin_loader.py skips `_*.py`), exactly like _google_core.py serves the
Gmail/Calendar pair and _printer_core.py serves the printer trio. Ship it
alongside whatsapp_call.py and whatsapp_guard.py; if a user downloads a plugin
without it the loader already names the missing file for them.

WHY THIS FILE EXISTS
    whatsapp_call.py grew a complete WhatsApp driver inside itself, and every
    line of it was Windows UI Automation. A second plugin that answers incoming
    calls needs the same driver, and a Linux user has no WhatsApp desktop app to
    drive at all. So the driver moved here, behind an interface, with more than
    one implementation behind it.

THE INTERFACE
    A Transport is "some way to reach WhatsApp". It can find the app, open a
    conversation, read back who is actually on screen, press the call buttons,
    send a message, and see an incoming call. What it CANNOT do it reports as
    unsupported rather than pretending.

    Three of them:

      WindowsDesktop  UI Automation against the WhatsApp desktop app. The
                      original implementation, moved here unchanged — same
                      Invoke-the-control approach, same header geometry, same
                      confirm-before-dialling contract.

      MacDesktop      The macOS Accessibility API (AXUIElement / AXPress),
                      which is the exact structural equivalent of UIA. Needs
                      pyobjc and the user granting Accessibility permission.

      Web             Playwright against web.whatsapp.com in a persistent
                      profile. Works identically on all three systems, and is
                      the only option on Linux, where there is no official
                      WhatsApp desktop application at all.

CHOOSING ONE
    The `transport` setting is 'auto', 'desktop' or 'web'. 'auto' prefers the
    desktop app — that is what most people actually run, and a call placed there
    rings in the real application with the real audio devices — and falls back
    to the web transport when this system has no desktop path.

EVERY LANGUAGE, STILL
    The folding rules, the ~20-language call-button vocabulary and the learned
    header-hint stripping all moved here untouched, because they are not
    Windows-specific: the web transport reads the same words out of aria-labels.

#
# WhatsApp publishes its controls under whatever name the user's WhatsApp is
# set to: "Sesli arama", "Voice call", "音声通話", "Прием", "ተቀበል". The obvious
# implementation is a table of translations, and it is the wrong one — a table
# is finite, it is stale the day a language is added, and the person it fails is
# always somebody the author never thought about.
#
# There is a model in this process that reads every language already. So the
# labels are handed to it and it says what each one is for. No vocabulary, no
# per-language rules, nothing to extend when WhatsApp ships a new locale.
#
# IT IS ASKED ONCE, NOT ONCE PER CALL.
# The answer depends only on the set of labels, which changes when the user
# changes their WhatsApp language and at no other time. So it is cached on disk
# and keyed by the labels themselves: one request per WhatsApp language for the
# lifetime of the install, and every ring after that is a dictionary lookup.
#
# WHEN IT CANNOT BE ASKED
# No API key, no network, or a model that is unsure: nothing is invented. The
# outgoing call buttons fall back to layout, which is safe because video and
# voice sit in a fixed order and pressing either still calls the person the user
# asked for. Answer and decline get no fallback at all — see the note on

    Seeing THAT a call is ringing needs no words at all: it is a panel, or a
    window, that was not there a second ago and carries a small cluster of
    controls. That works in Khmer and Amharic exactly as well as in English.

    Knowing WHICH of those controls answers and which refuses is a different
    question, and the layout trick the outgoing call buttons rely on must not be
    reused here. Video and voice sit in a fixed order and pressing the wrong one
    still places a call the user wanted; accept and decline do not, and pressing
    the wrong one either answers a call somebody wanted refused or hangs up on
    somebody they were waiting for. Both are done to a real person and neither
    can be taken back.

    So when the vocabulary recognises the controls, `identified` is True and the
    plugin may press them. When it does not, the call is still reported — the
    user is told who is ringing, which is most of the value — and every button
    press is refused with an explanation instead of guessed at.

#
# MEASURED, on WhatsApp's own window on this machine — a WinUI shell with about
# twelve thousand elements in its automation tree:
#
#     FindAll(subtree, Button)        3.40 s      3682 matches
#     FindAll(subtree, Text)          2.61 s      1229 matches
#     FindAll(subtree, Edit)          2.47 s       189 matches
#     FindFirst(subtree, Edit)        0.015 s     stops at the first hit
#     re-reading an element in hand   0.00025 s
#
# Two things fall out of those numbers, and between them they decide everything
# in this section.
#
# THE COST IS THE WALK, NOT THE ANSWER. Asking for Edits is no cheaper than
# asking for Buttons although there are twenty times fewer of them, and
# FindFirst is a hundred and sixty times faster than FindAll for no reason
# except that it stops early. UI Automation charges for elements VISITED, and
# TreeScope_Subtree visits all of them. Fetching the properties is small change
# next to that — and free outright with a cache request: 0.93 s of per-element
# property calls on the button scan became 0.02 s in a single round trip.
#
# AN ELEMENT SURVIVES THE WALK THAT FOUND IT, and re-reading one costs a
# quarter of a millisecond. So the expensive part need not be repeated.
#
# That is what was wrong with sending a message. Nothing in the sequence was
# slow; the sequence simply walked this tree about ten times — once to find the
# window, once to read the header, once to find the row, once to press it, once
# to check the right conversation opened, then five or six more while polling
# for the caret and for the text to appear in the box. Ten walks is fifteen to
# twenty seconds, and that is exactly what it took.
#
# Now the boxes are found once and HELD, and every question after that is put
# to the element itself. A walk happens when the elements are gone, and even
# that is answered by asking them rather than by walking.

        """Open a conversation to TYPE in it, without needing the keyboard.

        WHY THIS IS NOT open_chat().

        open_chat() searches, and searching means typing: Ctrl+F, the name,
        Enter. Every one of those keystrokes is global — it goes to whichever
        window Windows currently considers the foreground — so the whole
        sequence is guarded by "does WhatsApp have the keyboard", and when the
        answer is no it correctly refuses to type. That guard is not optional;
        without it a contact's name once went into JARVIS's own input box and
        the Enter behind it placed a real call.

        The trouble is that the moment this runs is the worst possible moment
        to be asking for the keyboard. A call has just been declined: WhatsApp
        tore down its call panel, the foreground is being handed around between
        windows that are closing, and the conversation window may not be back
        yet. So the honest answer to "does WhatsApp have the keyboard" is often
        no — and a message that is never typed is exactly what the user saw.

        A declined call, though, hands us something better than a search box.
        It bumps that conversation to the top of the chat list, and a chat-list
        row is a UI Automation element with an Invoke pattern: pressing it
        needs no pointer, no foreground and no keystroke at all. That is the
        same mechanism that pressed decline a second earlier, and it is the one
        thing here that has never depended on who owns the foreground.

        So: press the row if the row is there, and fall back to typing when it
        is not. Which route ran is invisible from outside — both return the
        conversation, and send_message_to() verifies it either way.

        Row matching is by identity (names_match/fold), never by vocabulary, so
        it behaves the same whatever language WhatsApp is in.

#  WEB — Playwright against web.whatsapp.com
#
#  The only transport that works on all three systems, and the only one that
#  works on Linux at all, since WhatsApp ships no official Linux client.
#
#  READ THE PAGE THE SAME WAY THE DESKTOP READS THE WINDOW
#      The temptation with a browser is to hardcode CSS selectors, and that is
#      exactly what rots: WhatsApp reissues its class names and data-testids
#      without warning. So the JavaScript below does not look for named
#      controls. It returns *every button in the header with its accessible
#      name and its rectangle* — the same shape _scan() returns on Windows —
#      and the Python side applies the same ~20-language vocabulary, then the
#      same left-to-right layout fallback. One rule set, two very different
#      trees underneath it.
#
#  A REAL BROWSER, NOT A HEADLESS ONE
#      Default is headed. A call needs a real audio device, the first login
#      needs a QR code on screen, and WhatsApp treats a headless browser with
#      suspicion. The profile is persistent, so the QR is scanned once.
#
#  ONE THREAD OWNS PLAYWRIGHT
#      The sync API is not thread-safe, so — exactly like the UIA apartment
#      above — a single long-lived worker owns the browser and every call is a
#      job submitted to it under a time budget.
